desc: Auto Vol - Send (Hit [Edit] for help)

// 
// What's this?
//
// Auto Vol keeps the sum volume of selected tracks at 
// a consistent level, no matter what the individual
// fader positions are. 
//
// This makes it possible to judge the sound of a blend 
// independently from volume changes.
//
// The Add variant is for summing tracks whose sum 
// volume is higher than the original volume (i.e. 
// parallel processing - NY compression and the like).
//
// The Split variant is for summing tracks whose 
// combined volumes sum up to the original (like for 
// example with M/S-splits).
//
// Both use the same Send plugin (Auto Volume - Send), 
// only the Receives differ.
// 
// 
// How?
//
// Insert Auto Vol Send on the selected tracks whose sum
// you want to control (where you put the fx doesn't 
// really matter but you can put it first in the chain so 
// it's out of your hair).
// 
// Send Audio and CV from this tracks to a master track 
// that has Auto Vol Receive as first fx in its chain.
//
//
// Audio Routing
//
// You can send audio on the first 8 channels any way 
// you like, but only the sum on Ch 1/2 of is modulated.
//
//
// CV Routing
//
// Ch 9 and 10 are reserved for the CV signals that 
// Auto Vol uses to determine fader positions.
// 
// Send Ch 9 pre-fader to Ch 9 on the master track and
// Ch 10 post-fader to Ch 10 on the master track.
